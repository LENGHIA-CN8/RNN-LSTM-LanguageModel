# RNN-LSTM-LanguageModel
## Implementing RNN and LSTM language model from scratch.</br>
Language modeling is the use of statistical and probabilistic techniques to determine the probability of a given sequence of words occurring in a sentence. </br>
For example:</br>
P1 = P("a quick brown dog") </br>
P2 = P("brown quick a dog") </br>
Good LM will have P1 > P2 

## Usage
Use jupyter notebook to run the model.</br>
